== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The changes I make show up on the Admin Editor page but do not appear in the frontend output =
Most probably, you have a caching plugin/option enabled on your WordPress website. While applying your modifications, please disable your caching plugin. After you have saved all the changes and see the changes in the output, you can then re-enable your caching configuration/plugin.

= Is there an option to adjust the width of the tour? =
The width of the Panorom tour is set to 100% of its parent container box. Thus, you can modify the tour's width by adjusting the width of the parent element where you place the Panorom shortcode.

= My images take too long to load =
By default, Panorom uses the original image size that was uploaded to WordPress. If your image file size is too large, you can reduce the image size before uploading it to your WordPress website.
